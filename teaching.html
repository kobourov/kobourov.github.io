</p><ul>
<li> <b>Spring 2006</b>: In spring 2006 I taught CS573, Theory of
Computation.  The course begins by reviewing properties of major
language classes in the Chomsky Hierarchy. Universal computation
models besides Turing machines, such as general recursive functions,
are examined to amplify the significance of Church's
thesis. Unsolvable problems and reducibility are studied. The bulk of
the course focuses complexity theory, the interrelationships among
complexity classes, and the study of both NP complete and provably
intractable problems. Topics covered include Church's thesis,
undecidability, complexity theory and intractable problems.


<p>
</p></li><li> <b>Fall 2005</b>: In fall 2005 I taught CS545, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. 
The emphasis of this course is on techniques for designing algorithms for various computer applications. In the process of learning and practicing methods of algorithm design, we will see many examples of important algorithms. We will also discuss techniques for implementing algorithms and improving program performance.

</p></li><li> <b>Fall 2003</b>: I taught CS645, Computer Interaction and Information Visualization.  We studied concepts underlying human-computer interaction, and information visualization through design and implementation of algorithms for HCI and InfoVis. Topics include: human capabilities (e.g., visual and auditory perception, memory, mental models, and interface metaphors); interface technology (e.g., input and output devices, interaction styles, and common interface paradigms); interface design methods and evaluation (e.g., user-centered design, prototyping, and design principles and rules, experiments); visualization techniques (visualization to enhance comprehension and analysis of structured information such as text collections, networked systems like the Web, work processes, etc.)

</p></li><li> <b>Fall 2002</b>: I taught CS473, Automata, Grammars, and Languages.
This course is an introduction to the fundamental models of
computation used throughout computer science: finite automata,
pushdown automata, and Turing machines. The hierarchical relationships
among these models, their relative power and limitations, and their
variants are studied. Student skills are developed in understanding
and using rigorous definition and proof to attack precisely formulated
questions about computability and computation. Topics covered include:
finite automata and regular expressions, turing machines, properties
of regular sets, Church's thesis, context-free grammars and pushdown
automata, recursive and recursively , enumerable sets, properties of
context-free languages, universal machines, undecidable problems, and
reducibility.
