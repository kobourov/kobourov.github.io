 This class will focus on the concepts underlying human-computer
 interaction, and information visualization through deisgn and implementation of algorithms for HCI and InfoVis. Topics include:
 <ul>
<li> human capabilities (e.g., visual and auditory perception, memory,
 mental models, and interface metaphors);
<li> interface technology (e.g., input and output devices, interaction
 styles, and common interface paradigms);
<li> interface design methods and evaluation (e.g., user-centered
 design, prototyping, and design principles and rules, experiments)
<li> visualization techniques (visualization to enhance comprehension
and analysis of structured information such as text collections, networked
 systems like the Web, work processes, etc.)
 </ul>

 This material will be covered through lectures, reading, discussions,
 homework assignments, and a substantial course project. In addition a
 set of case studies, in which notable interface designs and/or
 projects are analyzed as illustrative of underlying principles.
<p> 

For some of the projects we will use the <a href="www.acm.org/portal">ACM Portal</a> database. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Portal contains
bibliographical information about more than 100,000 research papers in computer science. Our research group has access to the data and we will be able to manipulate it directly. The projects will explore different ways of visually querying and interacting with the data. 
<p>
The other projects will use the <a
href="http://www.merl.com/projects/DiamondTouch/">Mitzubishi
DiamondTouch table</a>. The DiamondTouch table is a desktop device
that allows up to four users to simultaneously manipulate virtual
objects. Users can move objects around on the table by touching and
dragging them with their fingers. The purpose of the table is to allow
several people to interact with a program at the same time and to do
so using their hands rather than more common input devices such as
mice. <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/kobourov/tetris.pdf">Here</a> you can find see a description of one such project from
last year.
