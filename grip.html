 The GRIP (Graph dRawing with Intelligent Placement) system draws graphs. The inputs are simple undirected graphs (adjacency list or adjacency matrix) and the output is a drawing in 2D or 3D. The algorithm relies on a spring-embedder method, where the graph is treated as a spring-system. The final drawing corresponds to a low energy configuration. The examples above include meshes, a Bucky ball, a Moebius band, and the Sierpinsky pyramid of order 6. Graphs with tens of thousands of vertices and edges can be processed in seconds.
