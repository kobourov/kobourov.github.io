\subsection{Relevance for Industry}

From AT\&T's vintage UNIX {\tt dot}
package to the latest versions of popular software tools such
Pajek, Graphviz and yEd, the graph drawing community has provided high
quality, open source, practical tools used by a variety of users from
computer science and mathematics researchers to genealogy
hobbyists. Today, graph drawing tools and software packages have
millions of users and the interest in such tools is rapidly growing
due to the current interest in social networks and data visualziation. In
the last year alone Pajek had 100,000 downloads, yEd over 150,000 and Graphviz over 500,000 times.

Commercial graph drawing packages are also available through companies
such as Tom Sawyer Software, ILOG (now part of IBM), and yWorks. Researchers
and developers from both the open source and commercial sides are
frequent contributors and participants in the annual Graph Drawing
Symposium (which had its 17th meeting last year), the annual Bertinoro
Workshop on Graph Drawing (which had its 5th meeting in 2010) and the
relevant Dagstuhl Seminars.

\section{Description}

Visualization allows us to perceive relationships in large sets of
interconnected data. While statistical techniques may determine
correlations among the data, visualization helps us frame what
questions to ask about the data. The design and implementation of
algorithms for modeling, visualizing and interacting with large
relational data is an active research area in data mining, information
visualization, human-computer interaction, and graph drawing.

{\em Node-and-link graphs} in which vertices are the data objects and
edges correspond to the underlying relationships, and obtained via
graph embedding algorithm are often used to visualize such
relationships. Traditionally vertices are represented by points in
two- or three-dimensional space, and edges are represented by lines
between the corresponding vertices. The layout optimizes some
aesthetic criteria, such as, showing underlying symmetries, or
minimizing the number of edge crossings. The main objective is to
display the data in a meaningful fashion, that is, in a way that shows
well the underlying structures, and that often depends on the
application domain.

{\em Contact graphs} provide an alternative to the traditional
visualization metaphor for planar graphs, so that vertices are
represented by geometrical objects with edges corresponding to two
objects touching in some specified fashion.  Typical classes of
objects representing the vertices of the graph are line segments,
triangles, or rectangles. An early result is Koebe's 1936 theorem,
which shows that all planar graphs can be represented by touching
disks. Here we focus on side-to-side
contact graphs which resemble geographic maps, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:contact}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \vspace{-.2cm}
  \caption{\small\sf A planar graph and a side-to-side contact graph
    with each region represented by a convex polygon with at most 6
    sides.} 
  \label{fig:contact}
\end{figure}

{\em Map representations} provide a way to visualize relational data
with the help of the map metaphor. A contact graph representation of a
graph where the adjacency of vertices is expressed by regions that
share borders is an example \comm{just an example?} of a map
representation.  Such representations are, however, limited to planar
graphs by definition.  We can extend the notion of a map representation
to non-planar graphs by generalizing the idea as follows: clusters of
well-connected vertices form countries, and countries share borders
when neighboring clusters are interconnected; see Fig.~\ref{fig:gdmap}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    diagram and as a map.}
  \label{fig:gdmap}
\end{figure}

Providing efficient and effective data visualization is a difficult
challenge in many real-world software systems. One challenge lies in
developing algorithmically efficient methods to visualize large and
complex data sets. Another challenge is to develop effective
visualizations that make the underlying patterns and trends easy to
see.  These tasks are becoming increasingly more difficult due to the
impressive growth of data to be visualized in modern applications, as
well as their highly dynamic and data-intensive nature. 
%\comm{Do we
%  need this:} Developers can no longer ignore architectural aspects
%such as the presence of complex memory hierarchies and multiple cores,
%which are likely to shape the design of novel algorithmic techniques
%and the way they will be implemented and engineered in the future.

The ideas discussed here are also related to the notions of
cartograms and treemaps. Cartograms redraw an existing geographic map
so that the country areas are proportional to some metric (e.g.,
population), an idea which dates back to a paper by Raisz in 1934 and
is still popular today. Somewhat similar to cartograms, treemaps
represent hierarchical information by means of space-filling tilings,
allocating area proportional to some important metric (e.g., size of
the subtree of the clustering hierarchy).

\subsection{Topics of the Seminar}

Graph representations of side-to-side touching regions tend to be
visually appealing and have the added advantage that they suggest the
familiar metaphor of a geographical map. Maps offer a familiar way to
present geographical data (continents, countries, states), and
additional properties defined with the help of contours (topography,
geology, rainfall). Among the most commonly used types of maps are
navigation maps and public transportation maps (subways, trains,
buses). As a result, most people can ``read'' maps well, and often
find them intuitive and non-intimidating. This is one of the reasons
why we believe that maps offer a promising way for visualizing data.

Relational data sets are often visualized as collection of points in
two-dimensional space using principal component analysis,
multidimensional scaling, force directed algorithms, or non-linear
dimensionality reduction like LLE/Isomap. These embedding algorithms
tend to put similar items next to each other. Visual examination often
suffices to identify the presence of clusters. Sometimes, however, the
clusters are not as easy to see and additional visual clues are needed
to highlight them. One possibility is to use statistical clustering
algorithms such as $k$-means, spectral clustering, and
hierarchical clustering to explicitly define clusters.  The
points and labels can then be colored based on the clustering.  While
in small examples it is possible to convey the cluster information
just with the use of colors and proximity, this becomes difficult to
do with large data. Common problems include dense clusters where
labels overlap each other and clusters that lack clearly defined
boundaries.

Maps can be used to achieve this explicit visual definition of
clusters. There are several reasons why such a representation can be
more useful. First, by explicitly defining the boundary of the
clusters and coloring the regions, we make the clustering information
clear. Second, as most dimensionality-reduction techniques lead to a
two-dimensional positioning of the data points, a map is a natural
generalization. Finally, while graphs, charts, and tables often
require considerable effort to comprehend, a map representation is
more intuitive, as most people are very familiar with maps and even
enjoy carefully examining maps. In Figure~\ref{fig:gdmap} we have
drawn a collaboration graph using the traditional node-and-link
representation and using the proposed method which relies on the
geographic-map metaphor. Note that the vertices and edges are placed
in the exact same locations in both drawings and even the colors of
corresponding clusters are the same. Yet, the map makes the grouping
of tightly connected groups of vertices explicit.

Practical algorithms for visualizations based on node-and-link
representations, contact graph representations, and using the
geographic map metaphor can make an impact on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item graph theory: developing and studying characterization of graphs
  that can be represented by contact graphs;
\item computational geometry: designing and implementing algorithms
  for representing graphs as maps, focusing on the tradeoffs between
  region complexity, region-boundary slopes, and convexity;
\item information visualization: modeling and visualizing static and
  dynamic data sets using the map metaphor, focusing on creating
  representations which make the underlying data understandable and
  visually appealing;
\item human-computer interaction: studying the effectiveness of
  standard and novel visualization metaphors can lead to the
  development of more intuitive interfaces to large and complex data
  sets.
\item data mining: developing efficient and effective algorithms for
  interactive visualization of large and complex data can be used to
  augment existing clustering and machine-learning methods.
\end{enumerate}

Visualization tools must deal with large data sets which arise either
directly as giant networks (e.g., telecommunications) or in the
dynamic development of even medium-size networks, where temporal
information is used to examine the evolution of patterns (e.g., social
or computer networks).  The \emph{Rome graph library} and the
\emph{Stanford graph library} were among the first benchmark sets used
in experimental algorithms in general, and in graph drawing, in
particular. Even though the libraries are still widely used for
evaluating algorithms, they are outdated now because of size, degree
restrictions etc. Therefore these benchmark sets should be
complemented with databases of larger standard graphs and also dynamic
and evolving graphs from real-world applications, such as ArXiV and
DBLP collaboration and citation graphs, AT\&T telephone call graphs,
Internet AS graph, protein interaction networks, etc.


\subsection{Aims of the Seminar}

The main goal of this seminar is to foster fruitful co-operations
between researchers with interests in data visualization coming
from the information visualization, human-computer interaction, data
mining, and graph drawing communities. 

Data visualization can help understand the underlying relationships in
real-world data sets. It can also help discover patterns and forecast future
trends. However, the practical value of different visualization approaches
degrades unacceptably with larger data sets, and few if any tools can handle
large and dynamic data sets. With this in mind, the aims of the
Dagstuhl seminar are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To bring together data visualization experts from the
  information visualization, human-computer interaction, data mining,
  and graph drawing communities.

\item To discuss new methodologies and tools for developing faster
  algorithms for large (huge) graphs, e.g., heuristics where the
  complexity or the amount of data does not allow for the use of exact
  algorithms.

\item To formulate guidelines for the design of experiments and
  evaluation of algorithms, and to start working on the development of
  new benchmark sets (e.g., generic benchmark sets with certain
  characteristics, collections of real-world data from practical
  applications).

\item To study the performance (with respect to both quality and
  runtime) of current algorithms applied to real-world instances, and
  to theoretically analyze it.  This may help to develop improved
  algorithms for such instances.
\end{enumerate}

The format of the seminar will be such as to allow for presentations
as well as problem solving sessions, with the intention of promoting
exchange between the different participants and in encouraging the
work on specific open problems.  The first two days will be reserved
for overview presentations from representatives of the different
communities and for formulation of specific open problems and
formation of working-groups for the problems. The remaining three days
will comprise of working-group meetings and progress reports.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item How about we prepare short surveys (10-20p) in advance?
% \item Present seminar-relevant methods and tools.
% \item Present seminar-relevant studies and experiments.
% \item Present a seminar-relevant application, real world data.

\subsection{Relevance of the Topics}

Although many deep theoretical results came from the graph drawing
field, the experimental and practical aspects of graph visualization
also have a long and impressive history. From AT\&T's vintage UNIX dot
package (which dates back to the 1980's) to the latest versions of
Pajek, Graphviz and yEd, the graph drawing community has provided high
quality, open source, practical tools used by a variety of users from
computer science and mathematics researchers to genealogy
hobbyists. Today, graph drawing tools and software packages have
millions of users and the interest in such tools is rapidly growing
due to the current interest in social networks and bioinformatics. In
the last year alone Pajek had 100,000 downloads, yEd over 150,000 and
AT\&T's Graphviz package was downloaded over 500,000 times.

Commercial graph drawing packages are also available through companies
such as Tom Sawyer Software, ILOG (now IBM), and yWorks. Researchers
and developers from both the open source and commercial sides are
frequent contributors and participants in the annual Graph Drawing
Symposium (which had its 16th meeting last year), the annual Bertinoro
Workshop on Graph Drawing (which had its 4th meeting in 2009) and the
occasional Dagstuhl Seminars on Graph Drawing. The first Dagstuhl
seminar on Graph Drawing (Seminar No.\ 05191) took place in 2005 with
the aim to bring together theoreticians and practitioners from graph
drawing and various application areas. We used this chance to
establish fruitful contacts with graph drawing users. We also learned
that intensive cooperation is required for building successful graph
drawing solutions, taking into account application-specific user
needs.

The follow-up Dagstuhl seminar on Graph Drawing with Applications to
Bioinformatics and Social Sciences (Seminar No.\ 08191) led to
immediate multi-disciplinary collaborations. So far, five
multi-disciplinary papers originated in work that took place during
the seminar, some of which are already published in international
journals or conference proceedings. Furthermore, we received very
positive feedback from the participants. They reported on new
long-term collaborations that originated at the seminar, and also that
their participation helped to initiate or advance projects. Of note is
the development of the new CLIQUE research cluster, which is a joint
academic and industry research initiative focusing on graph and
network analysis and visualization. The feedback confirmed that the
acceptance of graph drawing methods in real-world applications is
highly dependent on the availability of robust algorithms that not
only offer good asymptotic performance in theory, but are also
designed and experimentally evaluated to meet the practical demands,
such as computing environment, input characteristics and permitted
response time.
